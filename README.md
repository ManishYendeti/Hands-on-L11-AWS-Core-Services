# Hands-on L11: AWS Core Services

This project shows how different AWS services work together to store data, organize it, and perform analysis. Using an E-Commerce sales dataset, the data is uploaded to S3, cataloged through AWS Glue, and queried in Athena to find useful business insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Information
Dataset: E-Commerce Sales Data  
Source: Kaggle  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data  

The dataset was uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. A Glue crawler was then used to detect its schema and create a table in the AWS Data Catalog.

## ðŸš€ AWS Workflow

| Step | Service | Task |
|------|---------|------|
| 1 | Amazon S3 | Created buckets and uploaded the input dataset |
| 2 | IAM | Created a role with permissions for Glue and S3 access |
| 3 | AWS Glue Crawler | Generated table metadata from the raw data |
| 4 | CloudWatch | Checked logs to validate crawler execution |
| 5 | Amazon Athena | Executed SQL queries to analyze the structured data |

## SQL Queries Executed in Athena

### Query - 1
<pre> ```SELECT 
    date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y') AS order_date,
    SUM(CAST(Amount AS double)) OVER (
        ORDER BY date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y')
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM "handsonoutputdb"."raw"
WHERE year(date_parse("Date", '%m-%d-%y')) = 2022
ORDER BY order_date
LIMIT 10; ``` </pre>
